# wormChat v1

2022.3.24. this is a simple chatbot that takes your text input,
processes it with a markov chain algorithm, and then spits out
a short string of machine-generated text. the idea is to later
attach this functionality to a simple animation of a baby worm,
so that it feels like you are talking to a worm. a bonus feature
is that the program uses text-to-speech to speak out the worm's
response.
